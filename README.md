# Credit Score Classification Project

### Overview
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to automate the classification of customers based on their credit scores.  
It was developed as part of a **Python Machine Learning** course project using a structured pipeline approach.

###  Objective
The goal was to build a supervised ML model that predicts whether a customer's credit score is **Good**, **Standard**, or **Poor**, based on financial and behavioral data.

### ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaned raw data, handled missing values, and removed unnecessary identifiers.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Processed numeric and categorical features using preprocessing pipelines.  
3. **Modeling:** Implemented a **Random Forest Classifier** due to its robustness and ability to handle mixed data types.  
4. **Evaluation:** Split the dataset into training and validation sets to evaluate accuracy.  
5. **Prediction:** Generated predictions for unseen data and saved them as `submission.csv`.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

### Limitations
The model was designed to be lightweight and interpretable rather than highly optimized.  
Due to limited resources and course scope, deep tuning and complex ensemble methods were not explored.

###  Key Learnings
- Built an end-to-end ML workflow from raw data to predictions.  
- Learned to manage mixed-type preprocessing and fix encoding issues.  
- Strengthened debugging and model evaluation skills.  

###  Results
- The model was trained and validated successfully.  
- Predictions were saved as `submission.csv` for unseen test data.
